                  Satta King is a kind of lottery game based on numbers from 00 to 99 which comes under <b>"Gambling"</b>. The real name of this game in Satta Matka, in which 
				  <b>"Satta"</b> means betting or gambling and <b>"Matka"</b> means a pot through which a number is drawn out. Over the decades, after official bans, it grew —disjointedly and very slowly — into Satta, a lottery-like game in which players bet on whether they can pick the correct numbers. Some mental bankettage explains why it cuts across India in distinct regional markets like Delhi, Disawar and Galion, each with its own legacy and timings.
